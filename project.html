<h4 class="whythisone"><b>What projects can we do to raise awareness?</b></h4>
<div class="temebi">
    <p> <b> 1. The "Remember Me" campaign</b>, which includes a week of trainings and workshops. Anyone can participate in this week and it will not be necessary to have any connection to medicine. <br>
        <b>Firstly,</b>  I would hold a poster competition where I would have participants make posters about Alzheimer's disease as they saw it. Then these posters would be exhibited and presented. </p>
    <p class="meore"> <b> The "Virtual Memory Wall"</b> will be the next part of the campaign. It will feature photos, stories and experiences from patients and their families. It will contain inspiring stories.
        Then, a series of <b>trainings and workshops</b>   will be organized, where invited guests will talk about Alzheimer's disease in general, what causes it, how it is diagnosed, managed and prevented. They will also discuss innovative diagnostic and treatment methods.
        Then, a series of <b> short films</b> will be shown on this topic and a group discussion will be held among the participants. Which will finally summarize the knowledge gained by the participants during the week.</p>
    
    <p>Ultimately, after this course, participants will create a <b> social media platform </b>where they will share the knowledge gained through blogs, podcasts, and help the interested public learn more about this disease. If this course is successfully completed, it will be held periodically.</p>
    
    <p class="meore"> <b> 2. "Care and Volunteering" </b>This is the next project that will be implemented with the involvement of medical students. They will undergo a detailed training course where they will initially study the specifics of Alzheimer's disease.They will study the causes of the disease, pathophysiology, methods of diagnosis and prevention. Only after that will they be able to volunteer at the Alzheimer's Care Center.</p>
    
    <p>Medical students will have the opportunity to volunteer at the Alzheimer's Care Center, which will be a great experience for them. They will be able to observe patients' symptoms in detail and see them in practice. They will gain experience in patient care directly from a mental and neurological perspective.  </p>
    
    <p class="meore">This project will be mutually beneficial for both patients and students. As patients receive more care and attention, they will also have to become more socially active, which will improve their mental health. This will also be very good for medical students, as it will help them make career choices. They will have to learn about neurodegenerative diseases, which include both neurological and mental aspects. They will also get a lot of experience working in a clinic. And of course, if this course is also successfully completed, it will be held periodically.</p> 
    
    <p> <b> 3. The final activity,</b> which involves raising awareness in an educational community, such as a school. This project can also be carried out by medical students. They will conduct small workshops for high school students where they will introduce the participants to the main information about Alzheimer's disease. Symptoms, causes, diagnosis and prevention. Which will help us to spread information about this disease from a young age.</p>
    
    <p class="meore"> <b> Each of these projects and awareness campaigns will help us spread the word about Alzheimer's disease in any community, including medical students, teachers, and anyone else interested. Ultimately, our goal of spreading the word about Alzheimer's disease will be achieved in small steps.</b></p>
