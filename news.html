                    <p>
                        The blood-brain barrier is a natural protective shield that prevents harmful substances from entering the brain. However, it also blocks the delivery of life-saving drugs, creating a significant challenge in treating conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease, addiction, and many other CNS disorders.
                        The BCC platform takes advantage of a specialized biological process called γ-secretase-mediated transcytosis to deliver large therapeutic molecules, like oligonucleotides and proteins, directly into the brain through a simple intravenous injection. "The blood-brain barrier is an essential defense mechanism, but it also presents a significant challenge for delivering drugs to the brain,"....

                        says co-corresponding senior author Yizhou Dong, PhD , Professor of Immunology and Immunotherapy, and a member of the  Icahn Genomics Institute  and the Marc and Jennifer Lipschultz Precision Immunology Institute, at Icahn Mount Sinai. "Our BCC platform breaks this barrier, allowing biomacromolecules, including oligonucleotides, to reach the CNS safely and efficiently."The study showed that when the researchers injected a compound called BCC10 linked to specialized genetic tools known as antisense oligonucleotides into mice, it successfully reduced the activity of harmful genes in the brain. In a transgenic mouse model of ALS (a motor neuron disease), the treatment significantly lowered levels of the disease-causing gene called Sod1 and its associated protein. Similarly, a different antisense oligonucleotide linked to BCC10 greatly reduced another gene, Mapt, which encodes the tau protein and is a target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.>

                    <p>
                        Artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to analyze complex brain imaging data, such as MRI and PET scans, to improve early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This method uses deep learning algorithms to automatically identify and track subtle changes in the brain that may not be visible to the human eye. By processing large datasets from neuroimaging studies, AI can detect patterns of brain atrophy or functional impairments that indicate early stages of Alzheimer's, often before clinical symptoms such as memory loss appear...

                        The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database is widely used in AI-based research. AI models trained on MRI, PET, and non-imaging data (such as demographic and clinical scores) have shown the ability to distinguish between mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively healthy controls with over 80% accuracy. In addition, longitudinal MRI data have been used to track the rate of atrophy, and AI models based on these scans have predicted the development of Alzheimer's in people at risk, up to 75.8 months before clinical diagnosis. <br>

                    <p>
                        Artificial intelligence models are increasingly being used to integrate and analyze genetic, biomarker, and behavioral data to predict the onset of Alzheimer's disease. For example, AI algorithms combine plasma biomarkers such as Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios with genetic factors such as APOE genotype, as well as behavioral data such as driving patterns (e.g., accelerating movements, braking behavior). This combination of factors could serve as an early warning system for Alzheimer's disease, allowing for early intervention....

                        In a study, AI was used to predict Alzheimer’s risk by analyzing blood biomarkers along with naturalistic driving behaviors. The AI model achieved a diagnostic accuracy (AUC) of 0.80, showcasing its potential to predict Alzheimer’s progression based on non-invasive and accessible data. <br>

                        Wearable devices with integrated artificial intelligence, such as smartwatches and smartphones, are being used to monitor physiological and behavioral changes that may indicate early Alzheimer's. These devices monitor a variety of factors, such as speech changes, motor functions, and even heart rate variability, all of which can be associated with cognitive decline. The data collected by these wearable devices is analyzed by artificial intelligence algorithms to detect patterns and potential early signs of Alzheimer's...

                        AI is being used to monitor vocal features and motor changes in people’s speech patterns over time. Devices can recognize subtle shifts in speech, such as slowed speech or reduced verbal fluency, which are signs of cognitive decline. These systems are designed for everyday use, providing a continuous, non-invasive way to track cognitive health​.
