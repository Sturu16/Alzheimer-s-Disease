            <h2> What is Alzheimer's disease?</h2>
            <p class="workp">One of the major reasons of neurodegenerative disorders is Alzheimer's disease. It affects millions of individuals worldwide. 60–80% of dementia cases in the world are caused by it, Therefore, it is the major cause of the illness. It damages 10% of humans older than 65 years and almost 50% of 85 years and older. The frequency of this disease increases by the older age. The brain is harmed by Alzheimer’s disease and has flagrant changes of brain atrophy. It is characterized by cognitive disorder, memory loss, misplace items and violation of coordination. For now, it has no cure. <b>Symptoms:</b> </p>
            <p class="workp1">
            <b>
                1.	Memory loss that disrupts daily life <br>
                2.	Poor judgment, leading to bad decisions<br>
                3.	Loss of spontaneity and sense of initiative <br>
                4.	Losing track of dates or knowing current location<br>
                5.	Taking longer to complete normal daily tasks<br>

            <p class="workp"> <b>What causes Alzheimer’s disease?</b>  <br> <br>
                The abnormal accumulation of proteins in the brain, particularly tau and amyloid proteins, is the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. This accumulation results in the formation of plaques and tangles that disrupt nerve cell communication. This causes brain cells to die over time, especially in the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory, before the death spreads to other parts of the brain. The more than 100 billion nerve cells that make up the human brain are essential for processes such as memory, learning, and thinking. 
                
              <span class="mtavarigamowveva">  While researchers believe that genetic abnormalities may play a role in early-onset Alzheimer's disease, late-onset cases are likely due to a combination of lifestyle, environmental, and genetic variables. It is still unclear exactly what causes the protein accumulation.</span> <br>

                <p class="workp"> <b>Prevention:</b> <br> <br>
                    • <b> Engage in mental activities</b> such as reading, playing board games, solving crossword puzzles, playing an instrument, or other pastimes that require "brain power."<br>
                    • <b>Engage in physical activity:</b>  Exercise improves blood flow and oxygen to the brain, which can affect the health of brain cells. Wear protective headgear when engaging in activities that carry a higher risk of head injury. <br>
                    • <b> Engage in social activities:</b> Talk to friends and family regularly and participate in group activities, including volunteer work, reading clubs, exercise classes, and religious services. <br>
                    • <b>Eat well: </b>Follow the DASH or Mediterranean diet, or another healthy diet rich in antioxidants. Consume alcoholic beverages in moderation.
