                <h2> <b> Awareness campaign </b></h2>
                <h4>This campaign aims to spread awareness about Alzheimer's disease in Georgia <span class="fundamental">  so that we can help more people understand their diagnosis and live as full a life as possible with their families.</span></h4>
                <p>Spreading information about Alzheimer's is very important to raise awareness in society. Especially in Georgia, there is very little information about mental and neurological diseases. Often, the symptoms that characterize Alzheimer's disease are perceived as an everyday norm, they do not pay attention to them, they do not go to the doctor, which is why the diagnosis is made late. I would like to emphasize that, nowadays, there is no cure for AD, so early diagnosis of this disease is important. I see this as the main challenge of this disease, because, unfortunately, the diagnosis of this disease is very expensive and many patients cannot afford these tests. So I think it should be government funded like it is for cervical cancer screening. Since this disease is very common and many cases remain undiagnosed, it is necessary for the government to introduce an annual screening program to support early diagnosis. Therefore, based on early diagnosis, symptomatic treatment and regular visits to the doctor are more effective, as this will reduce the risk of hospitalization and complications. Because with routine treatment we will be able to control the disease. And more active patients will help drive the latest research, which will hopefully lead to a successful treatment for Alzheimer's disease. <b> All of this will happen by raising awareness. This website is one of the first steps I will take to spread information about this issue.</b>
